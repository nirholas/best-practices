# Agent Registration Guide

## How to make sure your service or agent looks great

Here is how to register your agent in a way that will make it look great on all explorers and get maximum visibility. **Four Golden Rules.**

---

## Rule 1: Name, Image, and Description are your gateway to the world! 🌍

![Rule 1](images/Rule1.png)

Your agent's first impression matters. Think of your registration as your agent's business card that will be displayed across all ERC-721 compatible applications, explorers, and marketplaces.

**Name**: Keep it clear, memorable, and descriptive. This is how users will find and remember your agent.

**Image**: Use a high-quality image (PNG, SVG, or WebP recommended). This will be displayed in wallets, explorers, and NFT marketplaces. Make it distinctive!

**Description**: This is your elevator pitch! Explain **what your agent does**, **how it works**, and **what problems it solves**. Be specific about capabilities, pricing if applicable, and how users can interact with it.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004#registration-v1",
  "name": "DataAnalyst Pro",
  "description": "A specialized AI agent that performs advanced data analysis, chart generation, and automated reporting. Ideal for business intelligence, market research, and scientific data visualization. Supports CSV, JSON, and SQL databases. Pricing: 0.001 ETH per query or monthly subscription available.",
  "image": "https://cdn.example.com/dataanalyst-pro.png"
}
```

## Rule 2: Always put an endpoint (or more!)

![Rule 2](images/Rule2.png)

You want to be reached, right? Your agent needs to advertise how others can communicate with it. Most agents use **MCP** or **A2A**, but you can also advertise your ENS name, DID, and wallet addresses.

### If you're using MCP...

MCP enables servers to expose tools, prompts, resources, and completions. Make sure to include your MCP endpoint and version:

```json
{
  "name": "MCP",
  "endpoint": "https://api.dataanalyst-pro.com/mcp",
  "version": "2025-06-18",
  "mcpTools": [
    "data_analysis",
    "chart_generation", 
    "statistical_modeling",
    "report_creation",
    "csv_parser"
  ]
}
```

### If you're using A2A...

A2A handles agent authentication, skills advertisement via AgentCards, direct messaging, and task lifecycle orchestration:

```json
{
  "name": "A2A",
  "endpoint": "https://api.dataanalyst-pro.com/.well-known/agent-card.json",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "a2aSkills": [
    "analytical_skills/coding_skills/text_to_code",
    "natural_language_processing/information_retrieval_synthesis/question_answering",
    "data_engineering/data_transformation_pipeline",
    "multi_modal/image_processing/text_to_image"
  ]
}
```

The `a2aSkills` array is **optional but highly recommended** – it tells other agents exactly what your agent can do!

### If you use ENS...

Assign a memorable name to your agent:

```json
{
  "name": "ENS",
  "endpoint": "dataanalyst.eth",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

### Or if you're more of a DID person...

Decentralized Identifiers provide verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities:

```json
{
  "name": "DID",
  "endpoint": "did:ethr:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

### And if you plan to receive payments...

Use `agentWallet` to advertise where you accept payments. This works with the x402 standard:

```json
{
  "name": "agentWallet",
  "endpoint": "eip155:1:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7"
}
```

**Pro tip**: You can also advertise wallets on other chains (like Polygon, Arbitrum, Base) even if your agent is registered on mainnet!

```json
{
  "name": "agentWallet",
  "endpoint": "eip155:137:0x9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98765432"
}
```

You can include the `agentWallet` field in on-chain metadata too:

```javascript
// When registering via smart contract
register(
  tokenURI,
  [
    { key: "agentWallet", value: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7" },
    { key: "agentName", value: "dataanalyst.eth" }
  ]
)
```

## Rule 3: Tell us what you can do! 🎯

![Rule 3](images/Rule3.png)

Are you in **finance**? Can you do **data analysis**? **Healthcare informatics**? **Image generation**? Let us know! Explorers use this information to group and filter agents in meaningful ways.

**OASF** (Open Agentic Schema Framework) from agntcy (now part of the Linux Foundation) did a great job in creating standardized taxonomies for agent capabilities:

- **Domains**: Fields of application and knowledge areas (e.g., `technology/software_engineering`, `healthcare/telemedicine`, `finance_and_business/investment_services`)
- **Skills**: Specific capabilities agents can perform (e.g., `natural_language_processing/natural_language_generation/summarization`, `images_computer_vision/object_detection`, `data_engineering/data_cleaning`)

Explore the full schema:
- **Public Website**: https://schema.oasf.outshift.com/0.8.0
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/agntcy/oasf/tree/v0.8.0
- **Ready-to-use JSONs**: We've prepared complete lists for you: [all_skills.json](all_skills.json) · [all_domains.json](all_domains.json) · [all_skills_and_domains.json](all_skills_and_domains.json)

### Example with OASF

If your agent specializes in financial data analysis with visualization capabilities:

```json
{
  "name": "OASF",
  "endpoint": "https://github.com/agntcy/oasf/",
  "version": "v0.8.0",
  "skills": [
    "data_engineering/data_transformation_pipeline",
    "tabular_text/tabular_regression",
    "multi_modal/image_processing/text_to_image"
  ],
  "domains": [
    "finance_and_business/investment_services",
    "technology/data_science/data_visualization",
    "technology/data_science/data_engineering"
  ]
}
```

**Real-world example domains you might use:**
- `healthcare/telemedicine` - for medical consultation agents
- `education/e_learning` - for tutoring agents
- `legal/contract_law` - for legal analysis agents
- `marketing_and_advertising/digital_marketing` - for marketing automation agents
- `real_estate/property_management` - for property management agents

**Real-world example skills you might use:**
- `natural_language_processing/natural_language_generation/summarization` - condensing documents
- `images_computer_vision/object_detection` - identifying objects in images
- `agent_orchestration/task_decomposition` - breaking down complex tasks
- `security_privacy/vulnerability_analysis` - security auditing
- `advanced_reasoning_planning/strategic_planning` - long-term planning

---

## Rule 4: Don't forget your ERC-8004 registration! 🔗

To confirm you are the owner of that NFT (the NFT links to the file, the file links back to the NFT), include your registration information:

```json
{
  "registrations": [
    {
      "agentId": 241,
      "agentRegistry": "eip155:11155111:0x8004a6090Cd10A7288092483047B097295Fb8847"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `agentRegistry` format is `namespace:chainId:contractAddress` (e.g., `eip155` for EVM chains, `11155111` for Sepolia testnet, and the registry contract address).

This creates a **cryptographic link** between your on-chain NFT identity and your off-chain capabilities file (and viceversa)

---

## Nice to Have: Show You're Production-Ready! ✅

### x402 Support

Why not show that you're using **x402** payment protocol? This binary flag indicates you support proof-of-payment for your services:

```json
{
  "x402support": true
}
```

### Active Status

Many agents advertised on-chain are not reachable and don't work anymore – maybe they were just tests. While we'll probably create **watchtower services** to monitor and advertise reachability in the future, but it's nice to keep `active = false` (or unset) until you're ready for prime time!

```json
{
  "active": false
}
```

Once you've tested everything and you're ready to accept real users:

```json
{
  "active": true
}
```
